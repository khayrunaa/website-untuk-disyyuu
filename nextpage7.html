            Sayangg mass cintaa mass rinduu masss, I love you so much sayanggg, i'm bout to write some poetics text, hope you like it, Dear my ndaaa, 

            My heart once full, now overloadness love that i have.
            Since with you all this time, my world grew young.
            Your smile, your laugh, your loving gaze. 
            
            We shared our dreams, our joys, our fears. 
            Through all the years, through all the tears.
            
            All echoes of a love so grand.
            I reach for you, but you're not here so i can hug you. 
            I know im making you feel tears, and doubts, and fear.
            
            Do you remember our mid nights ride?.
            Our whispers, our promises, our love's delight?.
            Do you remember our first sight and met?. 
    
            I thought we still would be strong even we are LDR.
            But now, Im just can even stop thingking about u.
            
            I wander these empty world alone. 
            Searching for your presence, your gentle tone.
            But silence greets me, cold and grey. 
            A harsh reminder that you're far away.
            
            If only I could turn back time.
            I'd hold you closer, make our love shine. 
            But life moves on, and I'm left behind. 
            With just this longing, this heart of mine.
            Im always regreting, but not much if im ended up having happy life with you together. 
            
            your always,
            didiii. Im so sorry for yesterday, today and tomorrow. And I will always love you from yesterday, today and tomorrow ♥♥♥♥
